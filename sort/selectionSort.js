/**
 * Selection sort
 * 
 * Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values
 * into sorted position, it places small values into sorted position
 * 
 * Pseudocode
 * 
 * 1. Store the first element as the smallest value you have seen so far
 * 2. Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number
 * 3. If a smaller number is found, designate that smallest number to be the new "minimum"
 * and continue until the end of the array.
 * 4. If the "minimum" is not the value (index) you initially began with, swap the two values
 * 5. Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted
 * 6. Return the sorted array
 *
