Assignment 5

Level 1:

(a) Define, in pseudo-code, an algorithm to calculate the height of a tree. Hint: it needs to
be recursive.

Algorithm height(T)
return heightHelper(T, T.root())


Algorithm heightHelper(T, p)
 if T.isExternal(p) then
return 0
leftHeight ← heightHelper(T, T.leftChild(p)) 
rightHeight ← heightHelper(T, T.rightChild(p))
return MAX(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1


(b) Using the HW05-Tree.js, implement your algorithm in a JavaScript function Height(T). 
See attached javascript file.

(c) Implement your algorithm using the EulerTour template class provided in 
HW05-Tree.js, i.e., create a subclass of EulerTour with a method that calculates the height.
